## Build Challenge Prompt: Fraction Bakery

# Learning Objectives

Understand the concept of fractions and how they represent parts of a whole.
Identify fractions on a number line and in real-life situations.
Compare and order fractions.
Add and subtract fractions with common denominators.
Introduction:
Introduce the concept of fractions by explaining that a fraction is a part of a whole. For example, a pizza can be cut into four slices, and each slice is one-quarter (1/4) of the whole pizza. Show different objects that can be divided into fractions, such as a cake, a chocolate bar, or a pie. Then, explain that fractions can be represented as numbers and show how to write fractions using the numerator and denominator.

# Age Range

Fractions can be introduced to children as young as 5 or 6 years old. However, the understanding of fractions typically develops gradually over several years, and children may continue to learn about fractions throughout their elementary school years. Therefore, fractions are generally suitable for children in elementary school, typically from grades 1 to 6. The level of complexity of the concepts related to fractions can be adjusted based on the age and skill level of the children.

# Challenge

In this challenge, students will build a bakery that sells cakes and pies. 

The bakery needs to have a display case that shows the different types of cakes and pies available, along with their prices. 

The challenge is to use fractions to represent the prices of the cakes and pies.

# Instructions

Students can use the Minecraft Education Edition world-building tools to build the bakery. Encourage them to be creative and use a variety of materials to make the bakery look realistic.
Ask students to decide on the prices of the cakes and pies. For example, a chocolate cake could cost 3/4 of a diamond, while an apple pie could cost 1/2 of a diamond.
Have students create signs or price tags for each cake and pie, showing their prices in fractions. Encourage them to use common denominators so that they can compare and order the prices.
To challenge students further, ask them to add and subtract the prices of different cakes and pies. For example, what is the total cost of two chocolate cakes and one apple pie?
Assessment:
Assess students' understanding of fractions by checking their bakery display case and price tags. Ask them to explain how they came up with the prices and how they compared and ordered the fractions. You could also give them additional challenges, such as adding or subtracting fractions with uncommon denominators or converting fractions to decimals.

# Progression / Extended Learning

Learners who have a good understanding of fractions can progress to more advanced mathematical concepts, such as decimals, percentages, ratios, and proportions. Fractions are an important foundation for many other mathematical concepts, and understanding fractions is crucial for success in math throughout middle school, high school, and beyond. As students progress through their math education, they will encounter increasingly complex problems that involve fractions, such as solving equations with fractions, working with mixed numbers, and simplifying complex fractions. Mastery of fractions is an essential prerequisite for success in many areas of mathematics, including algebra, geometry, and calculus.

# Conclusion

The "Fractional Bakery" build challenge is a fun and engaging way to introduce elementary age children to the concept of fractions. 

By building a bakery and using fractions to represent prices, students can develop their understanding of fractions, and practice comparing and ordering fractions. This challenge can be adapted to different levels of difficulty to challenge students at their own level.
