Welcome to the NASA Artemis Minecraft Build Challenge! In this challenge, you will have the opportunity to learn about the skills, knowledge, and understanding needed to go back to the Moon through Minecraft Education.

Prompt:

NASA's Artemis program aims to land the first woman and the next man on the Moon by 2024. As part of the Artemis program, NASA is looking for innovative designs for habitats that can support human life on the Moon. Your challenge is to create a habitat that can support human life on the Moon for an extended period of time.

Instructions:

Research: Begin by researching the challenges of living on the Moon, such as radiation, lack of atmosphere, and extreme temperatures. You can use resources such as NASA's website, videos, and articles to help you understand these challenges.

Plan: Once you have a good understanding of the challenges, it's time to plan your habitat design. Consider the size, shape, materials, and features that your habitat will need to support human life on the Moon. Your habitat should be able to accommodate at least two people for an extended period of time.

Build: Using Minecraft Education, build your habitat design. Make sure to include all the features you identified in your planning phase, such as airlocks, radiation shielding, and life support systems.

Test: Test your habitat by simulating the conditions on the Moon, such as low gravity and extreme temperatures. You can do this by using Minecraft Education's environmental settings and by roleplaying the conditions inside your habitat.

Reflect: Reflect on your design and its effectiveness in supporting human life on the Moon. Consider the strengths and weaknesses of your design and how you could improve it in future iterations.

Share: Share your design with the class or with a partner and explain your thought process, challenges, and successes. Discuss how your design compares to other designs and what you learned throughout the challenge.

Learning Outcomes:

Through this challenge, you will develop skills in research, planning, design, and testing. You will also learn about the challenges of living on the Moon and the skills, knowledge, and understanding needed to support human life in space. Additionally, you will develop your creativity and problem-solving skills as you design and build your habitat.
